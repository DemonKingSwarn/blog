title: Broken Trusts

excerpt: "We were supposed to be friends, not betraying each other in a heartbeat. I always stood up to help them while they left me for someone they just met. We would never be friends again, and I would never want to see your face again."

Friendships are delicate, intricate relationships built on trusts, shared experiences, and mutual respect. I used to consider one person--let's call them as A--as my friend. Our friendship spanned for 6 whole years, and I thought we had a bond that was unbreakable.

It all started when A met someone new, uh lets call them G, so at first even G was a nice person. but then slowly G started becoming a little toxic, and A started always supporting them even when it was G's mistake. A and I started interacting way less than we used to and it became less meaningful now.

At first I was fine with this, I thought it was just a phase and that our friendship was strong enough to withstand it. But A slowly started becoming more distant. The final blow was when A started telling G about the things I told them in confidence, that they would never break my trust and tell this to anyone. This broke my trust on them, and when I confronted A for this, hoping for some answers, I was only met with defensiveness and blame. They didn't see the harm in their action and knocked it off my feelings as overreacting.

Their toxicity is now unbearable, the person I used to consider as friend is no more. And I dont think that we will ever be friends again. Yes, I am ending all ties with you, and you know who you are, so don't come to me asking what's all this about.

Their's one good thing which came out of this, this experience taught me about self-respect and the need to surround myself with the people who genuinely care for me. Friendship is a source of support and joy, not pain and betrayal. This lesson ultimately made me stronger and more discerning about the people I allow into my life.
