Hey everyone,

I hope you all have heard about the new Life is Strange: Double Exposure game. Max Caulfield's back, rewind powers in tow, and honestly? I'm not feeling it.

Don't get me wrong, I liked the first Life is Strange game but never loved it like how much I loved Life is Strange 2. And in my opinion I will say that LiS2 is the best Life is Strange game.

**Where's the Diaz Brothers Love?**

Seriously, LiS2 was a masterpiece. Sean and Daniel's story tackled some serious issues, stuff we don't see enough of in games. And let's not forget the whole brotherhood dynamic.

**LiS2 Deserves More**

Seriously, LiS2 got a lot of hate when it got released just because Max and Chloe wasn't returning in this. Even though the game was so damn good and it's protagonists (Sean and Daniel) were just too good, and I would say they were better than Max and Chloe. This game was so hated by the fans that even DeckNine doesn't talk about it anymore and it hurts. I really loved this game and I know some of the people who loved it too. Everytime one of us says anything related to LiS2, the fans of the first games starts coming at us and say that this game was just too bad. Like bruh how can you say the game was so bad when you never even played it? Just because this game doesn't have your favourite characters doesn't mean you have to hate it. It was a masterpiece, those colours, those stories, and your choices actually mattered in this game. It was just too good and you people have burried it just because it doesn't have Max and Chloe. Stop pretending that this game doesn't exist, try it yourself and I can guarantee you will love it. Just give it a try and see how wrong you were. Don't let your ego for not admitting this game ruin it.
