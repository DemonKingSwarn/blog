Ever since I started using linux, I've always been using X11 like the rest of linux users but recently I've started to use Wayland, and let me tell you, It's been a smooth ride. I don't think I can ever go back to X11 now. Here's why I like Wayland so much:

- Smoother Sailing: Ever notice that annoying screen tearing, especially when scrolling, watching videos or playing games? Wayland says goodbye to that with its superior graphics handling. It feels much more polished.

- Power Play: Wayland is built for modern hardware, and it shows. My laptop's battery life seems to be a lot better than when I used to use X11, especially while watching videos.

From my experience, NVIDIA GPUs aren't even a problem for me on Wayland. For me it just works, I installed the `nvidia-open` drivers though (which are NVIDIA's official open source drivers). 

Now, I'm not saying Wayland is perfect. There are still some limitations, like certain remote desktop tools not working as seamlessly. But for my use-case, Wayland is a clear winner for me. It's faster, more secure, and makes my desktop experience that much more enjoyable.

I will recommend checking this [site](https://arewewaylandyet.com/) to see if your program of interest is supported under Wayland or not.

What about you? Have you tried Wayland? Share your thoughts in the comments!
