So recently underDOGS Studio released [Mukti](https://www.muktithegame.com/) gameplay reveal trailer, and honestly at first I was skeptical after what we have seen turns out of [Mumbai Gullies](https://mumbaigullies.com/). But after I saw the gameplay reveal, I got some hopes that they can pull this off. And you know what changed my mindset? The developers of Mukti aren't acting like the developers of Mumbai Gullies or other Indian Game Dev Studio and selling it like an "Indian AAA", they are actually listening to people's feedback on places where the game looks rough which isnt a lot of places as the game looks way better and promising.

So I liked the gameplay reveal trailer, the game has some stunning visuals and some actually detailed environment. We could see some puzzles and all and even without significant story reveals, I can tell that the game has deeper meaning and an engaging storyline. This gameplay reveal has left me wanting more of it from them, and for the first time I am glad it's coming as a Playstation exclusive for a year because this way it can earn some money before coming to PC where the chances of it getting pirated is more.

Anyways don't forget to wishlist it on steam and PS Store:

[Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/760250/MUKTI/)
