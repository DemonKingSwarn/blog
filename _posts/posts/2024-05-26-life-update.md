Hey everyone,

So I have recently started my internship at [ProtaTECH Inc.](https://protatech.com/index.html) as a web developer, working with [Angular](https://angular.io/) and [ASP.NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/aspnet/what-is-aspnet). It's a 2.5 months internship as that's how much long my university holidays are for.

The people here are quite chill and are very very comfortable to work with, even the bosses here are quite nice. And the best part of this company is that it's located here in Gurgaon, Haryana. If you don't know then I have lived in Jalandhar, Punjab for about three years when I was a kid and from there I developed some closeness with Punjab, and even Haryana.

Office culture is quite fun but also tiring, but hey atleast I get some time to write this blog :)

Also my office is two minutes away from my brother-in-law's office, so I guess that's a plus.
