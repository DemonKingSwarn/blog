Hey everyone,

welcome back to yet another blog of me ranting about how I don't trust Ubisoft. So I am sure you guys have heard about the upcomingAssassin's Creed game set in Feudal Japan.

Don't get me wrong I love Assassin's Creed franchise, particularly the first three games. These games were by far the most immersive games in the entire franchise. The Ezio trilogy (Assassin's Creed 2, Assassin's Creed Brotherhood, Assassin's Creed Revelations) was the best era of this franchise.

The thing I am skeptical on Ubisoft about is that in the recent years Assassin's Creed's quality and historical accuracy have declined a lot.

- They are releasing too many Assassin's Creed games too frequently
- They are making the open worlds too big and focusing on quantity over quality
- They are not focusing on city based games like Assassin's Creed Unity
- They have introduced **microtransactions**
- The portrayal of a black character, Yasuke, as a Samurai in this upcoming game feels more likely a retainer and not a full-fledged Samurai.

Though I will make sure to keep an open mind about the story but I am not very hopeful because of Ubisoft's track record. Also I doubt it will be able to compete with the other open world games set in Japan, like Ghost of Tsushima.
