Hey guys,

So first of all happy new year to all of you. I know it's been a while since my last post but I have been quiet busy with my personal projects and a game I was working on which is now live on steam.

I am writing this post for sharing my Linux setup with all of you guys,

You can find my dotfiles [here](https://github.com/demonkingswarn/dotfiles), and my [neovim](https://github.com/demonkingswarn/nvim) and [tmux](https://github.com/demonkingswarn/tmux) respectively. Though note that I use neovim nightly (0.12+), so the plugins are set for its native plugin manager, you may need to change that if you are using the regular neovim.

Recently I have been loving the [niri](https://github.com/YaLTeR/niri) wayland compositor a lot. So much so that when I came back to [hyprland](https://hypr.land), I felt weird so I instantly switched back to niri.

For my gamer friends out there, here is my [steam profile](https://steamcommunity.com/id/DemonKingSwarn/).

My current setup has been reliable since 698 days.

Anyways that's all I wanted to share, I hope you guys are having a great year start :D
