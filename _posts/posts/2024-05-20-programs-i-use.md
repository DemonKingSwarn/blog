## Base

### [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org)

Arch Linux has been my linux distribution of choice since early 2021. It has been very reliable and trusty companion over the years, being less fragile and more stable than any other distro I have tried till now.

My current shell is zsh.
My window manager is [Hyprland](https://github.com/hyprwm/Hyprland), the wayland compositor.

### [JetBrains Mono](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/JetBrains+Mono)

My primary system font since I started using Arch Linux is JetBrains Mono, but I've also tried Iosevka in the past.
My emoji font is [Noto Emoji](https://fonts.google.com/noto/specimen/Noto+Emoji).

### [Floorp](https://floorp.app)

I'm currently using Floorp as my primary web browser, I like it because of its fast nature and the fact that it's solely based off of firefox. I've also extensively used both [Qutebrowser](https://qutebrowser.org/) and [Brave](https://brave.com/) in the past and can recommend them for enhanced privacy protection.

## Multimedia

### [Mpv](https://mpv.io/)

My media player of choice is mpv. It's great for both audio and video and the dominant choice among linux users. To mac users I can recommend [IINA](https://iina.io/).

### [FFMPEG](https://ffmpeg.org/)

I use ffmpeg to do basic audio and video post-processing and to convert between different encoders and formats. If you are on linux then it is often installed as a dependency of something else.

### [Imagemagick](https://imagemagick.org/)

I use imagemagick to quickly convert my images to different file formats.
For anything more advanced, I prefer using [gimp](https://www.gimp.org/).

### [YT-DLP](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp)

With yt-dlp I download youtube videos and musics.
Enough said.
